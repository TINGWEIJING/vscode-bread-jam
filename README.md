## FAQ
1. Why is it called "Bread Jam"?

    Initially, I thought about naming this extension something straightforward like "Variable Color." However, it offers more than just adding color—it also has the option to decorate with emojis. In the future, I plan to add various other render patterns. This led me to a fun metaphor:

    Think of coding in your editor/IDE as having breakfast. Just as people enjoy different types of breads—like white bread, bagels, croissants, and buns—programmers have their favorite themes, such as Dracula, Monokai Pro, One Dark Pro, Night Owl, etc. But sometimes, just bread isn't enough; it can get a bit boring. You might want to jazz it up with different jams or ingredients to enhance the flavor. Similarly, "Bread Jam" aims to spice up your coding environment. Of course, just like with actual bread, not everyone will want to add jam—that's perfectly fine too!
